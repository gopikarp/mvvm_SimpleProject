The app provides a simple user interface with a title bar and a central content area.
The content area displays the current color and speed of the virtual car.
Users can change the car's color by tapping buttons labeled "Change Color to Red" or "Change Color to Blue."
Users can set the car's speed to 60 mph by tapping the "Set Speed to 60 mph" button.
When users interact with the buttons, the UI updates to reflect the changes made to the car's state in real-time.

## This "Car Control App" serves as a basic demonstration of how to implement the MVVM pattern in a Flutter application to separate concerns and manage the state of a virtual car's properties. It can be a starting point for building more complex apps with similar architecture.


A new Flutter project.
